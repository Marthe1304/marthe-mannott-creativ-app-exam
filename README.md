"infnity_morpher" is a program i wrote, that will generate a sequence of images based on a given image and render these into a video. The inital image is turned into a 1-bit black and white image, and optionaly the resolution is decreased. The images are generated by recalculating each pixel, based on the color of the eight pixels next to it, the time since the pixels was changed the last time, and the overall balance of black and white pixels in the previous image. As far as my testing goes 8-bit RGB or B/W images in the JPEG and PNG format work fine, but other formats supportet by the Pillow Library should work too, as long as they are 8-bit RGB or B/W.
The Programm will create a image and a video folder with date und time code for each run, containing the individual images and the final video.


To run "infinity morpher" you can use the follownig code:
    
    from infinity_morpher import infinity_morpher
        
    infinity_morpher(fp_image, iterations, pixelate_factor, white_threshold, frame_rate, weight_factor, decay_factor)

The "infinity_morpher" function requires the following arguments:

"fp_image" | string | The file path of the image you want to start with

"iterations" | integer | 1 - infinit | how many new images are supposed to be generated

"pixelate_factor" | integer | 1 - lenght of the shorter edge of the original image | factor by which the initial image is pixelated/resolution reduced. 1 -> original resolution, for e.g. 3 -> 3 by 3 pixels are merged together

"white_threshold" | integer | 0-255 | as the image is converted from 8-bit depth to 1 bit depth you can input the threshold above which a pixel is white, and below which it is black

"frame_rate" | integer | 1 - infinit | frame_rate the video is rendered at

"weight_factor" | integer or float | no limit | factor, by which the balance of black and white pixels affects the image genreation. -2 -> no effect, 0 -> minimal impact, >0 -> more impact, < -2 reverse impact may lead to all pixels turning black or white

"decay_factor" | integer or float | no limit | factor, by which the likelyness of a pixel to change its state is increased with increasing age (time since last change of state). Small decay_factor results in bigger features in the genreated images 0 -> no change
